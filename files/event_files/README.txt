The purpose of events files is to describe timing and other properties of events recorded during a run. Events are stimuli presented to the participant or participant responses.

Several important things to note: 

- A single event file MAY include any combination of stimulus, response, and other events.

- Events MAY overlap in time. 

- Please mind that this does not imply that only so called "event related" study designs are supported (in contrast to "block" designs) - each "block of events" can be represented by an individual row in the events.tsv file (with a long duration).

- Each task events file REQUIRES a corresponding task data file. The events file name must have the name of the corresponding data file indicated in it's name (e.g., sub-001_ses-01_task-pixar_run-01_events.tsv)

- Columns indicating the onset and duration are required. Optionally, a trial_type column can be included - this is almost always needed to indicate which events the onset and durations refer to.

- Event onsets for pixar assume a 10s delay between the start of acquisition and the start of the movie.
