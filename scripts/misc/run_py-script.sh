# RUN MISC PYTHON SCRIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH FMRI PIPELINE
#
# This script runs the python script specified in the command call within a nipype singularity:
# A config.tsv file must exist in the project directory. This file has the processing options passed to
# the pipeline. These parameters are likely to vary for each study, so must be specified for each project.
#
# The nipype singularity was installed using the following code:
# 	SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/RichardsonLab/processing SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/RichardsonLab/processing sudo singularity build /RichardsonLab/processing/singularity_images/nipype-1.8.6.simg docker://nipype/nipype:latest
